To start the project, the file Hierarchy must be like this:
|
|-> Main folder of the project
|-> JSONconf/
(they must be at the same level)

The JSONConf can be found in the deliverables folder, it has to be copied as described above.
Also in server and client configuration file that can be found in the JSONconf folder copied before modify the client and server addresses with the local address of server and client.

Firstly, the user has to start the Server.jar that can be found in Deliverables and then start the Client.jar processes.

Issues:
ANSI dependence:We don't use anymore clearScreen() in the CLI version. The reason is that the game results enjoyable the same way and we preferred to print the output consequently.
